# VARGPBML

Implementation of "Variational Learning of Inducing Variables in Sparse Gaussian Processes" (Titsias, 2009) for the course of Bayesian Machine Learning of the MVA master's degree.

Each GP_{method}.py contains the class of the GP regression method. 

Each compagnon notebook tests on the dataset (taken from http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~snelson/) using different sizes of training set.
